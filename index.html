    <h2 id="other theories"><u>Other theories about the stages of Life</u></h2>
    <p>Erik Erickson's theory isnt the only one out there, for years, philosophers, psychologists, and acedemics have debated the number of life stages and when they occur. To get a better perspective on all the stages of life and how this framework can help you, lets take a look at some of the other theories.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development</dt>
        <dd>While Erikson proposes eight stages of life, Jean Piaget proposes only four. <blockquote>His theory looks at the nature of intelligence.</blockquote> He believes that the way children acquire knoowledge determines the progression of mental development.</dd>

        <ol>
            <li>sensorimotor (birth to two years old)</li>

<h2>Erikson's stages of psychosocial development</h2>
<P>From Wikipidi, the free encyclopedia</P>

<p><strong>Erikson's stages of psychosocial development,</strong> as articulated in the second half of the 20th centurhy by Erik Erikson in the collaboration with Joan Erikson, is a comprehensive psychoanalytic theory that identifies a series of eight stages that a healthy developing individual should pass through from infancy to late adulthood.</p>
<p>Accoridng to Erikson thoery the result from each stage, whether possitive or negative, influence the results of succeeding stages. Erikson published a book called <i>Childhood and Society</i> in 1950 that highlighted his research on the eight stages of psychosocial development. Erikson was originally influenced by Sigmuned Freud's Psychosexual stages of development. He began by working with Freud's theories specifically, but as he began to dive deeper into biopsychosocial development and how other environmental factors affect human development, he soon progrressed past Freud's theories and develop his own ideas.</p>
<p>Erikson's stage theory characterizes an individual advancing through the eight life stages as a function of negotiating their biological and sociocultural forces
